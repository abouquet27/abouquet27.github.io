Introduction The development of quantum computers presents a significant threat to classical Public-Key cryptographic systems. Many widely deployed cryptographic primitives, such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)—rely on the hardness of integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problem. These problems are vulnerable to quantum computers, and therefore enhance research on post-quantum cryptographic scheme.</description></item><item><title>Bienvenue on my website</title><link>/posts/first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 11:50:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>/posts/first-post/</guid><description>This site serves as my journal, on which I share things that intrigue me, as well as my portfolio, where I publish the different (academic) papers I&amp;rsquo;ve written, or my resume.

I am a Swiss-French student presently enrolled a Joint Master’s degree in Cybersecurity (Computer Science) between the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and Zurich (ETHZ), since September 2023. While pursuing my Master’s degree, my main interests were Cryptography, Information Security, Software Security, Privacy Engineering, Machine Learning and Network Security. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with an emphasis on Software Engineering, Theory of Computation and Mathematics, at EPFL between 2020 and 2023.</description></item><item><title>Building a robust test suite of type confusion vulnerabilities</title><link>/writings/type-confusions/type-confusions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/writings/type-confusions/type-confusions/</guid><description>This paper was written under the supervision of Nicolas Badoux and Prof. Doc. sc.

Abstract C++ has a lot of vulnerabilities due to type confusion, which can lead to memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.</description></item></channel></rss>
