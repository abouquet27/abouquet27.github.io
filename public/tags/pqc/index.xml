Introduction The development of quantum computers presents a significant threat to classical Public-Key cryptographic systems. Many widely deployed cryptographic primitives, such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)â€”rely on the hardness of integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problem. These problems are vulnerable to quantum computers, and therefore enhance research on post-quantum cryptographic scheme.</description></item></channel></rss>
